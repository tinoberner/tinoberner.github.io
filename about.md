Hi, I’m Tino Berner — Agile Coach, technology enthusiast, and lifelong learner.
<br>
I help teams and organizations unlock their potential through better ways of working and thoughtful use of modern technology. My sweet spot lies where people, process, and tech meet — and real change becomes possible.
<br>
Based in Hamburg, I currently support cross-functional development teams at MOIA. I design and facilitate org-wide training programs, coach teams on the ground, and help shape sustainable improvement processes. My approach blends hands-on technical experience with a human-centered coaching mindset — enabling teams to grow, adapt, and deliver meaningful value.
<br>
Before stepping into coaching, I worked as a DevOps engineer: building large-scale monitoring solutions, managing containers, and learning what makes resilient systems tick. That background still shapes how I think — from designing change that sticks to speaking the language of engineers and architects.
<br>
Over the years, I’ve supported agile transformations across international teams, guided stakeholders through uncertainty, and helped organizations implement agile frameworks that actually work. I hold certifications in Scrum (PSM I & II), SAFe, and Kanban, and I’m currently expanding my cloud expertise with AWS and in the field of Cybersecurity.
<br>
I believe that good processes don’t replace thinking and that sustainable change starts with listening, not with a framework.
<br>
Let’s build better ways of working — together.
