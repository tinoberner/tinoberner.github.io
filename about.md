Hi, I’m Tino Berner — Agile Coach, technology leader, and lifelong learner.
<br>
I help teams and organizations unlock their potential through better ways of working and thoughtful use of modern technology. My sweet spot lies where people, process, and tech meet — and real change becomes possible.

Based in Hamburg, I currently support cross-functional development teams at MOIA. I design and facilitate org-wide training programs, coach teams on the ground, and help shape sustainable improvement processes. My approach blends hands-on technical experience with a human-centered coaching mindset — enabling teams to grow, adapt, and deliver meaningful value.

Before stepping into coaching, I worked as a DevOps engineer: building large-scale monitoring solutions, managing cloud infrastructure, and learning what makes resilient systems tick. That background still shapes how I think — from designing change that sticks to speaking the language of engineers and architects.

Over the years, I’ve supported agile transformations across international teams, guided stakeholders through uncertainty, and helped organizations implement agile frameworks that actually work. I hold certifications in Scrum (PSM I & II), SAFe, and Kanban, and I’m currently expanding my cloud expertise with AWS.

I believe that good processes don’t replace thinking — they support it. And that sustainable change starts with listening, not with a framework.
<br>
Let’s build better ways of working — together.
