What a week it has been!

Roughly a week ago my first deployments in AWS happened, I couldn't stop there.<br>
The autodeployment was set the app was running so it was time to go further, <br>
and by that I mean "make it enterprise-ready".
First of all all the insfrastructure changes had to to be persistent, so I wanted to try out
AWS SAM CLI - which was easier done than I expected. Not that I would perfectly know what kind
of template.yml Claude was preparing for me but I was happily trying it out - and it worked! 
I was able to just modify everything via code <3<br>
Having set up this, Claude and I focused on my app again. Since there was not much happening without
users I wanted to emulate them with a load generator.<br>
This is were my memory becomes fuzzy because quite a lot went downhill.<br>
Does it mean that I do not trust AI any more? No.<br>
Does it mean that with every change I now exactly want to know was Claude does? Yes.<br><br>
Time flew by by cleaning up the repository and setting everything up from scratch again,<br>
so that now I have a beautiful dashboard in Cloudwatch and even tried out an alert via SNS (Mail).
It was great to see an alert in the inbox and how relatively easy this was (thinking back at prometheus back then and the alertmanager).

So the architecture is updated as well - so it is time for the next challenge!<br><br>
Side note: No, I am not using the root user for all this :)
