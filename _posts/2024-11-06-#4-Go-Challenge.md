 .. by learning a little bit of go on the side.

 For this I started at youtube by checking out this video on ["time to learn go? here's how"](https://youtu.be/_7Fz6HcDaOw?si=b5zyXwmLkz5i66pN).
 The video directly brought me to [learn go with tests](https://quii.gitbook.io/learn-go-with-tests) where I now learn step by step.

 Quickly I became to realise that I need to reactive also my github skills why I then connected my VS Code to my github account.

 Which brought me to the idea to also update my blog.
End for now :)
